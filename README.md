This is not just a computer language, this is natural language, English. 
If you want to improve your English skill, recitation can be one of the most traditional ways to improve your speaking, listening, and writing. This is Steve Jobs Stanford Speech, a segmented speech, his speech is opened at Stanford universicty's website, but it is his note and not his own actual delivery at the commencement on the stage.
For my perfect training I prepared his speech by listening his words carefully.
His speech's right is reserved by Stanford, CA 94305.
